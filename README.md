# Syntax-Slayers
Project Name: AI for Wi-Fi Outage Prediction at SMIT

### Project Overview

The AI-driven network monitoring system for Wi-Fi outage prediction at SMIT aims to enhance network reliability by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns and detect anomalies. This system will proactively identify potential Wi-Fi outages, allowing for timely interventions such as rerouting traffic or rebooting faulty hardware, thereby minimizing downtime and improving user experience.

What is the proposed solution?

-The primary goal of this project is to develop an intelligent network monitoring solution that can predict and prevent Wi-Fi outages at SMIT. By integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning, the system will:

-Analyze Network Usage Patterns: Continuously monitor network traffic and usage data to identify normal behavior and detect deviations that may indicate potential outages.

-Detect Anomalies: Use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to spot unusual network activity that could lead to outages.

-Proactive Intervention: Implement automated responses, such as rerouting traffic or rebooting hardware, to address detected issues before they escalate into significant outages.

-Reduce Downtime: Minimize the impact of network disruptions on users by ensuring quick recovery and maintaining high network availability.

## Collaboration Steps

_For those who want to collaborate on GitHub, follow the steps below:_

1. **Download Git**
   - Download Git for Windows from your preferred browser.
   - During installation, do not interfere with any customized options.

2. **Fork the Repository**
   - Open GitHub and create a fork of this repository on your profile.

3. **Clone the Repository**
   - Create a folder on your drive where you want to work on this repo.
   - Go to the address bar, click on it, type `CMD`, and press Enter to open a command prompt window.
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     git clone <HTTPS-link-of-this-repo>
     ```

4. **Open in VS Code**
   - Type:
     ```bash
     code <HTTPS-link-of-this-repo>
     ```
   - Then type:
     ```bash
     code ./
     ```
   - This will open a VS Code window with your directory connected.

## Prerequisites

_To run the provided Flask application, you need to install several Python modules. Here is a list of the required modules and how you can install them:_

- **Flask**: This is the main framework used to create the web application.
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  pip install mysql-connector-python
```

(You have to go to your python installation folder to install pip by opening cmd in that directory)

By following these steps, you will have all the necessary modules installed to run your Flask application._

## Contribution Workflow
Now you can finally work on this code. Collaborate and add more features as much as you want. After your work is complete, do the following steps in order to upload it again to your forked repo:
1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Syntax-Slayers
   ```

2. For those working on code:

   ```bash
   cd Syntax-Slayers
   ```

3. For frontend team:
- First execute the above line, then:
   ```bash
   cd static
   cd css  # For CSS
   ```
   ```bash
   cd static
   cd js  # For CSS
   ```
   ```bash
   cd templates  # For HTML
   ```

4. Initialize Git (if not already initialized):

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

5. Check status and stage changes:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```
      ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   ```
      ```bash
   git status #Ensure file is staged
   ```

6. Commit and push changes:

      ```bash
   git commit -m "Updated by Your Name"
   ```
      ```bash
   git push
   ```

Congratulations!
You have successfully completed all the steps! Happy collaborating!
