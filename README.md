Project Name: AI for Wi-Fi Outage Prediction at SMIT

### Project Overview

The AI-driven network monitoring system for Wi-Fi outage prediction at SMIT aims to enhance network reliability by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns and detect anomalies. This system will proactively identify potential Wi-Fi outages, allowing for timely interventions such as rerouting traffic or rebooting faulty hardware, thereby minimizing downtime and improving user experience.

What is the proposed solution?

-The primary goal of this project is to develop an intelligent network monitoring solution that can predict and prevent Wi-Fi outages at SMIT. By integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning, the system will:
-Analyze Network Usage Patterns: Continuously monitor network traffic and usage data to identify normal behavior and detect deviations that may indicate potential outages.
-Detect Anomalies: Use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to spot unusual network activity that could lead to outages.
-Proactive Intervention: Implement automated responses, such as rerouting traffic or rebooting hardware, to address detected issues before they escalate into significant outages.
-Reduce Downtime: Minimize the impact of network disruptions on users by ensuring quick recovery and maintaining high network availability.
